# Warehouse Typescript Challenge

Typescript Challenge for medior/senior

> Build a warehouse packaging line.

Build packages based on the `orders` list found on the API.

- Build complete packages of required articles
    - Connect an invoice with total price & articles
- Produce a restocking list for items that will run out of stock soon.
- Throw helpful warnings when orders are unable to be executed.
- 💥BONUS💥: unit test your code with `jest`.

No need to build an interface, output in console is fine.
